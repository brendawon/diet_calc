# Instructions

Users can calculate caloric needs the quick, simplified way or by using the built-in, evidenced-based Mifflin St. Jeor equation. 

For the simplified method, only height and weight are required. Utilize the other inputs (gender, age, and activity/stress factor) to see the results of Mifflin St. Jeor. 

Gender can be selected or deselected with just a touch. 

Pressing on the age, height, and weight cards will bring up the number pad. 

Users can toggle between cm/in and kgs/lbs to instantly convert from metric to standard or from standard to metric units. Similarly, users can toggle between activity factor or stress factor and use the slider to select the appropriate metabolic multiplier. 

Pressing the 'CALCULATE' button will bring the user to the results page, where BMI, MSJ/Simplified Caloric, Protein, and Fluid needs are displayed, as well as helpful ranges based on common clinical conditions.
